#### Contact

- András Kovács, email: kovacsandras @ inf.elte.hu (without spaces).
- Rafaël Bocquet, email: bocquet @ inf.elte.hu (without spaces).

#### Infrastructure, online teaching

- Compiler installation: [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/)
  is recommended, or
  [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/). For text editing,
  any editor is fine alongside GHCI.

- Microsoft Teams: *lectures* take place on Teams (synchronously with on-site lecture), and they are recorded.
  Q/A during exams also happens on Teams.
  + You can register on Teams with inf account and password.
  + Every students gets an email with an invitation link to the course Teams group.

- Discord: *tutorials* take place on [Discord](https://discord.com/), also synchronously with in-per  son lab.
  + There is one Discord server for the course, each tutorial group has a separate voice channel.
  + Every student gets an email with an invitation.

- Assignment/homework submission: https://canvas.elte.hu
  + We will publish technical details of the submission in the first week

- Lecture and tutorial notes are found at: https://github.com/AndrasKovacs/ELTE-func-lang/tree/master/2021-22-1

#### Prerequisites

The content of the BSc "functional programming" course, or equivalent prior
knowledge. I recommend to review the [beginner
Haskell](http://lambda.inf.elte.hu/Index.xml) notes.

#### Requirements

- Tutorial requirements:
  + There is a 10 minute canvas assignment at the start of each practice, except
    the first one. 0, 1 or 2 points can be awarded for each.
  + Three larger homework assignments will be created, for 4 points each. The deadline for all of these is the end of the semester study period
  + Min. 13 practice points have to be acquired during the semester.

- Tutorial attendance is mandatory, with max 3 absences, in accordance with the hybrid attendance regulations.
  + Online attendances is recorded through canvas submissions. So it is important to submit to canvas, even if the
    submission is incomplete.
  + On-site attendance is recorded through student roster.
- Lecture attendance is recommended but *not* mandatory.
- The course grade results from an exam in the examination period. Usage of any
  material/internet is permitted on the exam, but communication/collaboration
  with exam takers or third parties is not permitted. The exam is ca. 2 hours
  and consists of computer exercises. Exam submission is also on canvas.
- The prerequisite of exam taking is the fulfillment of tutorial
  requirements.

#### Curriculum

- Algebraic datatypes
- Type classes
- Basic classes: Eq, Ord, Show
- Semigroup, Monoid
- Functor, Foldable
- Monad, specific monads: Reader, State, Maybe, list, IO
- Applicative, Traversable
- Parser monad
- Monad transformers
- Parsers and interpreters for simple languages

#### Materials

- Course materials and exercises are uploaded to this repository. Tutorial
  materials go to "gyak_X" folders, where "X" denotes the group code wihch can
  be found in neptun.
- Exams and exercises for previous semesters can be also found in this repository.
- Recommended literature: http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters,
  https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell
